# computer vision
Note: When working with image datasets, we first must consider the total size of the dataset in terms of bytes. Is our dataset is large enough to fit into the available RAM on our machine? Can we load the dataset as if loading a large matrix or array? Or is the dataset so large that it exceeds our machine’s
memory, requiring us to “chunk” the dataset into segments and only load parts at a time?
